# Bioinformatics code

This is the source code from a Stepik course by [Phillip Compeau](https://stepik.org/users/3/teach) that I did in 2018.

It has been probably the most interesting coding I have ever done, so I am adding some links to similar free online content by Phillip.

The course has since (I think) been replaced by updated courses like [this one](https://stepik.org/course/121010/promo); it has a lot more content and a better introduction for newcomers is either of these options:
* [Phillip's book available online](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) - the first 5 chapters are free
* [This bioinformatics chapter](https://programmingforlovers.com/chapter-1-finding-replication-origins-in-bacterial-genomes/introduction-the-most-beautiful-experiment-in-biology/) of Phillip's programming course called **Programming for Lovers**

I hope you enjoy these as much as I did!
