# Bioinformatics code

This is the source code from a [Stepik course](https://stepik.org/course/55929/promo?search=3958687939)

It has been probably the most interesting coding I have ever done, so I am adding some links to similar free online content by the same author.

There are [many others including more advanced courses and several on COVID-19](https://stepik.org/catalog/search?lang=en&q=bioinformatics);

Other good introductory bioinformatics exercises are:
* [Phillip's book available online](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) - the first 5 chapters are free
* [This bioinformatics chapter](https://programmingforlovers.com/chapter-1-finding-replication-origins-in-bacterial-genomes/introduction-the-most-beautiful-experiment-in-biology/) of Phillip's programming course called **Programming for Lovers**

I hope you enjoy these as much as I did!
